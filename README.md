# CommonLily Weekly Bookmarks Review
## Week 1
### April 27 - May 1, 2020

As a person new to the software testing scene, I seem to accumulate more and more bookmarks each week related to learning about coding, software testing, social media, and much, *much*, more.  For the sake of my Type A sanity, I have created this weekly review to go through the bookmarks I've amassed over the last week.  

In these weekly posts, I will cover each individual bookmark and write a breif review based on it's usefulness to a new-to-software testing individual. My hope with this will be to create somewhat of an online resource for other people with little to no experience in the computer science.

Now let's get to the bookmarks I have explored:

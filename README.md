# CommonLily Weekly Bookmarks Review
## Week 1
### April 27 - May 1, 2020

As a person new to the software testing scene, I seem to accumulate more and more bookmarks each week related to learning about coding, software testing, social media, and much, *much*, more.  For the sake of my Type A sanity, I have created this weekly review to go through the bookmarks I've amassed over the last week.  

In these weekly posts, I will cover each individual bookmark and write a brief review based on it's usefulness to a new-to-software testing individual. My hope with this will be to create somewhat of an online resource for other people with little to no experience in the computer science.

To kick things off, let me first describe my knowledge of computers. I have none. There, done.  

I did have some helpful advice from a friend in the industry who gave me some starter points. With their advice I first went to GitHub.

I will categorize these books marks as follows:
- Recommendation (Do Not Recommend, Recommend, Highly Recommend) 
- Skill type or knowledge (Beginner, Moderate, Advanced) 
- Content Material (Article, Video, Tutorial, Software, Other)

Now let's get to the bookmarks I have explored:

1. [GitHub Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  - Highly recommend - Beginner - Tutorial 

    As I mentioned, my friend directed me to GitHub. This was the first guide of theirs that I read and it was an incredibly helpful piece to read to not only learn about Markdowns but how to use them. Working through the guide while reading made for very easy learning. Also included some helpful links to other guides and articles in GitHub. 
  
2. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  - Recommend - Moderate - Other 

    This is what I am currently using to make this page on bookmarks.  It allows you to turn your Markdown files into a simplistic webpage and display your content in a user friendly environment.  I had a little bit of trouble in updating the Page once I first published it.  I marked this as Moderate because it can be a little confusing at first.  I recommend watching the video GitHub posted about Pages [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY#action=share).

3. [ATOM](https://atom.io/)

  - Highly Recommend - Moderate - Software

    ATOM is a software compatible with GitHub that allows you to make changes to your markdown files outside of GitHub. It makes the interface a little more user friendly and has the capability of viewing your changes immediately alongside your code (similar to the preview tab on GitHub). Below is a screen capture of me using ATOM to create this markdown. I personally like this interface more than the GitHub interface.

    I still have a lot to learn about ATOM and its capabilities, so I am rating this as moderate because it took a little fiddling around to understand the basics.

4. [Galvanize](https://www.galvanize.com/full-time)

  - Highly Recommend - Beginner - Tutorial

    Galvanize is a online learning program.  They provide free courses that prep you for their paid online immersive program.  But their free courses are excellent for beginners with little to no experience with programming.  I haven't completed their free programming yet, but I have learned a lot from the lessons I've completed so far.  Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking to gain some basic knowledge of programming languages. 

    They also have a Slack group you can join so you can ask questions!
